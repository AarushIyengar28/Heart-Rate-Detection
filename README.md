# ❤️ Heart Rate Detection  

This project applies **data analysis** and **bioengineering fundamentals** to develop a heart rate detection system. It processes **ECG data** to calculate heart rate using various data science libraries.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  

- AD8232 ECG Sensor - Gets electrical signals serial data from humans with electrodes
- Arduino Uno R3 - Used to transfer and display Serial Data from AD8232
- **NumPy** – For numerical computations and data manipulation  
- **SciPy** – For signal processing and analysis  
- **Pandas** – For handling and structuring ECG datasets  
- **Matplotlib** – For visualizing ECG waveforms and heart rate calculations  

## 🚀 Future Plans  

- Develop an MVP that holds the AD8232 and the wiring and has an LCD Display that displays BPM 
- Enhance accuracy through **advanced filtering and peak detection techniques**
