# Heart-Rate-Detection
This project uses data analysis and bioengineering fundamentals to make a heart rate detection system. I am using Numpy, Scipy, pandas, and Matplotlib to use ECG data calculate heart rate. This is a prototype, but I plan to try making a sensor with Arduino using C++ to get the data and determine heart rate.
